Obviously Voltaire was a big fan of Bootstrap.

## Overview

>In this assessment, you will take a Figma design from Frontend Mentor and implement it using Bootstrap. This project simulates a real-world task where you receive a design handoff and are expected to create a responsive, pixel-perfect webpage. You will apply your knowledge of Bootstrapâ€™s grid system, components, and utility classes while utilizing version control through Git.

The assignment states pixel-perfect so generic Bootstrap clearly does not suit.  We are instructed to use components "where appropriate".  It is not appropriate.

>2. Bootstrap Implementation . . . Include Bootstrap components like cards, buttons, navbars, or accordions where appropriate.

[Bootstrap documentation on cards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/) does not state specifically what each card class changes.  This is fine and expected for Bootstrap's expected use case of building fast but limited websites, but no good for this assignment use case of "pixel perfect".  *We are allowed discretion, and I'm using it.  There are loads of associated Bootstrap classes none of which are well documented, I'm not spending hours going through generated code to change behaviors with SASS, in the process breaking Bootstrap's original functionalities, then hunting down all the issues the changes create, in the end leaving Bootstrap's original card classes and every class affected by changes broken.  Extensive changes to Bootstrap classes is completely besides the point of Bootstrap supposedly making things fast and simple.*

Among other Bootstrap/pixel perfect/good coding practice conflicts that may be expected, detailed in later sections, a pro account was required to download Figma files off Frontend Mentor.  We could download other files; I moved some of them into Figma and worked with them to get pixel sizes.

## Reflection

Bootstrap should not be used for pixel-perfect projects, unless those project specifications coincide exactly with Bootstrap's presets.  The assignment explicitly mentioned multiple times the importance of "pixel perfect", so I used SASS enough that it would have been far simpler and easier to ignore Bootstrap and use regular CSS instead.  I did use Bootstrap wherever possible, to meet assignment requirements.

I would not make "improvements" given more time.  Bootstrap is suited to building quick projects where its limitations are kept firmly in mind, with minimal use of SASS and/or !important.  Building pixel perfect projects with design specifications not created with Bootstrap in mind is entirely besides the point of using Bootstrap in the first place.

## Customizing Bootstrap with SASS

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-customize-bootstrap-with-sass/

Prerequisites:  Node.js with npm or yarn, code editor (using VSCode), understanding SASS.

npm i bootstrap@5.3.6

I did not actually use "npm install -g sass" below, as it should be a global install that I had already performed for Lab 3-3.  I did use it at that time though. 
npm install -g sass

Entered in HTML head

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="./node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">`
`<link rel="stylesheet" href="customsass.css">`

Created custom_scss folder in repository folder.
Created custom.scss in custom_scss folder.

Entered in custom.scss
`@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";`

Note import should always be last line.

>Variables are suffixed with a !default (a Sass flag) in Bootstrap. The !default flag tells the compiler to set the value only if the value is not defined.

>So, we set the variables before the @import directive so that, later, the compiler sets our value instead of the default ones.

Set up test HTML code

`<body>`
  
  `<div class="bg-primary">`
    `Test Default Blue`
  `</div>`
  `<div class="bg-secondary">`
    `Test Default Gray`
  `</div>`
  
`</body>`

Add to beginning of custom.scss file

$primary: teal;
$secondary: red;

In Bash, enter

sass custom_scss/custom.scss:custom_bootstrap.css

(Can generate file in subdirectory, using sass custom_scss/custom.scss:subdirectory/custom_bootstrap.css)

Change HTML head from

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="custom.css">`

to

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="custom_bootstrap.css">`

After every edit of custom.scss, above Bash command must be entered.

The HTML file should show blue and gray divs before entering the above Bash command, aqua and red divs afterwards.  If not, debug.
