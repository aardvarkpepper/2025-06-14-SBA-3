Obviously Voltaire was a big fan of Bootstrap.

## Overview

>In this assessment, you will take a Figma design from Frontend Mentor and implement it using Bootstrap. This project simulates a real-world task where you receive a design handoff and are expected to create a responsive, pixel-perfect webpage. You will apply your knowledge of Bootstrap’s grid system, components, and utility classes while utilizing version control through Git.

The assignment states pixel-perfect so generic Bootstrap clearly does not suit.  We are instructed to use components "where appropriate".  It is not appropriate.

>2. Bootstrap Implementation . . . Include Bootstrap components like cards, buttons, navbars, or accordions where appropriate.

[Click to see Bootstrap documentation on cards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/) does not state specifically what each card class changes.  This is fine and expected for Bootstrap's expected use case of building fast but limited websites, but no good for this assignment use case of "pixel perfect".  *We are allowed discretion, and I'm using it.  There are loads of associated Bootstrap classes none of which are well documented, I'm not spending hours going through generated code to change behaviors with SASS, in the process breaking Bootstrap's original functionalities, then hunting down all the issues the changes create, in the end leaving Bootstrap's original card classes and every class affected by changes broken.  Extensive changes to Bootstrap classes is completely besides the point of Bootstrap supposedly making things fast and simple.*

Among other Bootstrap/pixel perfect/good coding practice conflicts that may be expected, detailed in later sections, a pro account was required to download Figma files off Frontend Mentor.  We could download other files; I moved some of them into Figma and worked with them to get pixel sizes.

## Reflection

Bootstrap should not be used for pixel-perfect projects, unless those project specifications coincide exactly with Bootstrap's presets.  The assignment explicitly mentioned multiple times the importance of "pixel perfect", so I used SASS enough that it would have been far simpler and easier to ignore Bootstrap and use regular CSS instead.  I did use Bootstrap wherever possible, to meet assignment requirements.

I would not make "improvements" given more time.  Bootstrap is suited to building quick projects where its limitations are kept firmly in mind, with minimal use of SASS and/or !important.  Building pixel perfect projects with design specifications not created with Bootstrap in mind is entirely besides the point of using Bootstrap in the first place.

## Customizing Bootstrap with SASS

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-customize-bootstrap-with-sass/

Prerequisites:  Node.js with npm or yarn, code editor (using VSCode), understanding SASS.

npm i bootstrap@5.3.6

I did not actually use "npm install -g sass" below, as it should be a global install that I had already performed for Lab 3-3.  I did use it at that time though. 
npm install -g sass

Entered in HTML head

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="customsass.css">
```

Created custom_scss folder in repository folder.
Created custom.scss in custom_scss folder.

Entered in custom.scss
`@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";`

Note import should always be last line.

>Variables are suffixed with a !default (a Sass flag) in Bootstrap. The !default flag tells the compiler to set the value only if the value is not defined.

>So, we set the variables before the @import directive so that, later, the compiler sets our value instead of the default ones.

Set up test HTML code

```
<body>
  <div class="bg-primary">
    Test Default Blue
  </div>
  <div class="bg-secondary">
    Test Default Gray
  </div>
</body>
```

View to verify first div is blue, second div is gray.

Add to beginning of custom.scss file

$primary: teal;
$secondary: red;

In Bash, enter

`sass custom_scss/custom.scss:custom_bootstrap.css`

(Can generate file in subdirectory, using sass custom_scss/custom.scss:subdirectory/custom_bootstrap.css)

Change HTML head from

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="custom.css">`

to

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="custom_bootstrap.css">`

After every edit of custom.scss, above Bash command must be entered.

The HTML file should show blue and gray divs before entering the above Bash command, aqua and red divs afterwards.  If not, debug.

## Processing .jpg Through Figma

I copied provided .jpg files into Figma, then used Shape Tools to draw rectangles to fit each component, with 100% transparency and stroke of different colors to create outlines.  Used corner radius as necessary.

## Processing Figma into Bootstrap

Style guide states widths of 375 and 1440 used, respectively.  Screenshots are provided of 1440x900 and 375x1996.

I think it clear the 375-width view is intended to be vertically scrollable.

For 1440x900 resolution, the cards fit together too neatly to use dynamically sized cards, especially considering there is no obvious rule indicating when lengthy text should break to the next line.  So the five cards will be fixed in size for this resolution.  As the cards are fixed in size and relation to one another, they may be considered collectively as a single element of size 1110x572.

[Click to view webpage on Bootstrap breakpoints.](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/)

I intend to use default xl 1200px Bootstrap breakpoint to display the fixed element of 1110x572.  All narrower resolutions will use dynamically sized components with top margin of 71px and left/right margin of 24px consistent with displayed design.

## Balancing Assignment Requirements

The assignment states multiple times that pixel perfect is important.  It only states once "Use Bootstrap’s grid system to create a responsive layout that adjusts for different screen sizes."  I do not believe it possible to use a responsive layout using Bootstrap's grid system for the challenge I chose for the assignment.

The problem is the challenge does not feature elements that may be reasonably dynamically sized.  Bootstrap's grid system uses twelve columns, making the minimum fraction 1/12 (0.08333333).  The margin at 1440 width is 165; 165/1440 = 0.11458333, enough to accommodate one column on each side.  However, the margin at 1200 width is only 45; 45/1200 = 0.0375.  The margin at 375 width is 24; 24/375 = 0.064.

Explicitly, Bootstrap's grid system could be used to create a three-column setup, with left and right columns varying in width in one-twelfth increments of screen width (minmum one-twelfth), and the main content taking up the rest of the room depending on screen size.  But any responsive design would not come from use of Bootstrap's grid system, but dynamically resizing the component in the center column using code that has nothing to do with Bootstrap's grid system.

Further, Bootstrap's grid system that uses twelve width increments can't even be usefully used with three or more columns for a lot of wider screen sizes below 1400, as the minimum column size on left and right would make margins wider than specified in the design specs.

I can imagine ways to meet the use Bootstrap's grid system to create a responsive layout that adjusts for different screen sizes, for example integrating Javascript to split single elements into multiple elements, including fractions of geometric shapes, fractions of letters, but that is beyond the scope of the assignment, would take more time than I would care to spend, and would be terrible coding practice.

So I implement a single column using Bootstrap's grid system and use media queries to adjust for different screen sizes.  That is all that can reasonably be done for this particular challenge.

## Oddities

I could not use SASS to overwrite 'muted' to apply to Bootstrap's 'text-muted' class.  'Muted' may reference another color as a baseline.

Using Bootstrap "d-flex flex-row" and commenting out my 'xframewide' references to display: flex; and flex-direction: row; caused the wide frame to be visible in smaller screen sizes.  Though I left the HTML element with the xframewide class, it seems the media query switching .xframewide to display: none may have been invalidated.

```
@media (max-width: 1199px) {
  .xframewide {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

        Light grayish blue: hsl(210, 46%, 95%)

        Note for text colors:

        1. "Verified Graduate" has the same color as the person's name with 50% opacity
        2. Review paragraphs inside the quotations have the same color as well, but are at 70% opacity
